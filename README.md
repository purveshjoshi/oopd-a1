# oopd-a1

I started first by creating a new repository on my firefox(linux).

Then I cloned it by

git clone https://github.com/purveshjoshi/oopd-a1.git
cd oopd-a1

Being a complete begineer I had to set up my Github account first.
Then I learnt how to create a token for password, checkboxed on repo for the PAT and then cloned it.

Then I did this on my terminal
cd oopd-a1
ls
(saw readme)
nano q1.cpp
(wrote a simple code printing Hello! Purvesh)
git add q1.cpp
(It asked who you are so)
git config --global user.name "purveshjoshi"
git config --global user.email "joshipurvesh007@gmail.com"

Then I pushed it into git and did an apt update.

Then I made a file gitignore because we do not want a file containing *.o, *.out,*.exe,a.out,q2,q3,.vscode/,*.swp
Then commited it to prevent the binaries
